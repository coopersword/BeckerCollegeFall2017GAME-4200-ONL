When I was 12 years old, I saw the movie "Kick Ass", and wanted to try to do parkour. I started trying to jump off of things, vault over things, and do combat rolls.
This led to a situation in which the local police were sent to retrieve me from jumping off of some buildings. When I saw them, however, I ran from them into the woods
that were near my house. From there, I managed to sneak into my own house, where I proceeded to hide under my desk. My parents weren't home, and I didn't want to 
answer to the police. Later that night, I saw flashlights shining through the woods. I assumed the police were looking for me still, and proceeded to stay inside for
that whole weekend. The police never found me, and I moved away from that town two years later.
